# TradeUp?
Problem Statement: 
This application should allow for the swapping of items using a barter system. Many people have trouble getting rid of things that they no longer have use for but also continue to accumulate newer items that they do want. This application solves this problem by allowing people to accumulate new items that they want and getting rid of items they don't want at the same time. This is better for the environment than throwing away unwanted items and also saves users money.
